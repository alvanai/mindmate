## About the Project

### Inspiration  
Mental health struggles are often invisible, yet they affect millions worldwide. Many people lack access to affordable, stigma-free support tools. We wanted to build something simple, accessible, and personal  a companion in your pocket to help people track, understand, and improve their mental well-being.  

### What We Learned  
Through this project, we deepened our knowledge of:
- **React Native & Expo** for building cross-platform apps  
- **Mobile UI/UX** for wellness-focused design  
- **State management & data persistence** for saving user mood logs and reflections  
- The importance of **empathetic design** when creating tools for mental health  

### How We Built It  
We built **MindMate** using:
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo  
- **Backend / Data Storage:** Local storage (AsyncStorage) for privacy-first offline functionality  
- **Features:**  
  - Mood tracking with daily prompts  
  - Guided breathing & mindfulness exercises  
  - Journal entries with sentiment analysis  
  - Light/dark mode for user comfort  
- **Design Tools:** Figma for prototyping, Expo for rapid testing on Android  

### Challenges We Faced  
- **Expo CLI changes:** Adapting to the new `npx expo` and `eas build` workflows  
- **UI performance:** Ensuring smooth animations without impacting battery life  
- **Mental health sensitivity:** Designing language and prompts that are supportive without being intrusive  
- **Testing across devices:** Handling differences in Android screen sizes and performance  

### Impact & Next Steps  
MindMate aims to make mental wellness tools accessible to anyone with a smartphone, especially in underserved communities. Our next steps include:
- Adding cloud sync for cross-device usage  
- Introducing AI-powered mood insights  
- Expanding language support for global reach
